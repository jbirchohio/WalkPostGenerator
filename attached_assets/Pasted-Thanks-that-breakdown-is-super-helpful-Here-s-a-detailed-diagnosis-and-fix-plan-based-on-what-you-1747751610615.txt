Thanks — that breakdown is super helpful. Here's a detailed diagnosis and fix plan based on what you're requesting and where you're hitting issues:

✅ What You're Requesting:
🔹 Facebook – Post Insights API (Primary)
plaintext
Copy
Edit
post_impressions
post_impressions_unique
post_engaged_users
post_reactions_by_type_total
✅ These are valid post-level metrics and should work only if:

You're using the full composite post ID: {page_id}_{post_id}

The post was created by the Page, not shared or boosted by someone else

The access token is a valid Page access token with pages_read_engagement

🔹 Facebook – Post Data Fallback
plaintext
Copy
Edit
reactions.summary(true)
comments.summary(true)
⚠️ The issue is not these fields, but how you're requesting them.

❌ Deprecated usage:
http
Copy
Edit
GET /{post_id}?fields=attachments{media_type},... 
✅ Fix: Use only valid fields
http
Copy
Edit
GET /{post_id}?fields=reactions.summary(true),comments.summary(true),message,created_time
⚠️ Do not use attachments{...} — that’s what's triggering the error:

(#12) deprecate_post_aggregated_fields_for_attachement is deprecated

🔹 Instagram – Media Insights
You're using:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
engagement
impressions
reach
saved
✅ These are correct. However, engagement and saved are only returned if:

The post is from an Instagram business account

It was published via the Graph API, not manually

✅ What You Should Do
🔧 Fix 1: Clean Up Fallback Facebook Post Data Request
Update your fallback to:

ts
Copy
Edit
const fallbackUrl = `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${postId}?fields=reactions.summary(true),comments.summary(true),message,created_time&access_token=${pageAccessToken}`;
Remove any attachments, media_type, or deprecated post fields.

🔧 Fix 2: Validate Instagram Media Insights Results
If you're getting empty values from:

http
Copy
Edit
GET /{media_id}/insights?metric=engagement,impressions,reach,saved
...check:

That the IG post was published via API

Your token includes instagram_manage_insights

Also, consider fallback fields for Instagram:

http
Copy
Edit
GET /{media_id}?fields=like_count,comments_count,media_type,timestamp
💡 Suggested Updated Facebook Logic (TypeScript-style)
ts
Copy
Edit
const validMetrics = [
  'post_impressions',
  'post_impressions_unique',
  'post_engaged_users',
  'post_reactions_by_type_total',
];

const insightsUrl = `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${pageId}_${postId}/insights?metric=${validMetrics.join(',')}&access_token=${token}`;
Fallback if error:

ts
Copy
Edit
const fallbackUrl = `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${pageId}_${postId}?fields=reactions.summary
